I've always felt that I am more productive when I share my work or study with others. This caused me to have many blogs 3 main blogs/websites in the past.
* 1 was focused in national and international science olympiads informing people about the multiple competitions that there exists, and explaining how to study for them www.olimpiadascientificas.com.
* Another explained my own methods of study, motivations and stories related to those same science competitions.
* And later I made a third blog focused on the activities I took part on, such as biking, running or exploring.

This website will focus in projects, HOWTOs and small hacks or suggestion such as command line scripts, easier ways to run programs, suggestions for how to edit pictures, and so on.

This website was created using Jekyll, using the Holo Alfa theme. It will be temporarily hosted in github pages before probably moving to a personal server.

Welcome.
