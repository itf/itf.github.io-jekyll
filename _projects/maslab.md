We built Cocoabot, a robot capable of finding cubes on a field and stacking them by color. 
Cocoabot had around 10.000 lines of C++11 code, split in 10 threads, running in an Intel Edison.

I was responsible for integrating the modules, writing the skeleton code for the threads, designing the state machine and the motor-controllers code, debugging the
code with GDB and finding memory leaks. Documented on tinyurl.com/cocoabot.
