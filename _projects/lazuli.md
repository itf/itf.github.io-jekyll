I took HDR pictures from the rooms of Lazuli Motel in Botuca, SP, Brazil, and created a website for it, using Hugo as a static website generator.

 The website was intended to be accessed on 3g networks, so the image quality and sizes were chosen in such a way to improve the user experience, and it is also a single page website in order to not reload already loaded information, and if the user's network fails, they can still continue to see the information that has already been loaded.
