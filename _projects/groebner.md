Proof of concept that it is possible, in a reasonable time, to test the solvability of linear networks by calculating the Groebner basis of the linear network ideal. 

It implements an algorithm described on An Algebraic Approach to Network Coding by Ralf Koetter, Member, IEEE, and Muriel MÃ©dard, Senior Member, IEEE.
