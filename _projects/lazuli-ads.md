Created ad campaigns for the Lazuli Motel website I previously created with a tight budget. For about $1 a day for 3 months, it brought approximately 80 extra visitor to the website per day. The average time spent per user on the website was 3 minutes. 

It was not possible to analyze exactly how many clients the ad campaign brought to the business, but given how many times the business got contacted by phone during the ad campaign it seems that the campaign was fairly successful.
