First Brazilian website to help high school students and teachers to participate in Science Olympiads.   
Used to have ∼500 visits per day.  
Made with wordpress.org, migrated to jekyll in 2016 after a problem with the wordpress website.  Dozens of volunteers have helped with the website, helping provide material, write news and find information about the competitions. 



It was cited by the largest Brazilian newspaper in 2012, tinyurl.com/ocientificas.
