I am Ivan Tadeu Ferreira Antunes Filho, currently an MEng student in EECS at MIT. I'm really excited about science, technology and photography.

I took part in multiple science olympiads back in highschool, here is a list of the competitions.

### In the Media (2011-2013)

And because of the science olympiads, I've also appeared in the media a number of times. Here are some interviews to newspapers, magazines and TV.
